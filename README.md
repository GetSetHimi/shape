## 🎨 Visual Learning System

### Color Psychology in Design
```css
:root {
  --primary: 39 100% 50%; /* Bright Orange - Stimulates creativity */
  --accent: 84 60% 50%; /* Yellow-Green - Promotes learning */
  --background: 33 56% 95%; /* Light Yellow - Reduces eye strain */
}
```

- **Warm Color Palette**: Scientifically chosen colors that promote learning and creativity
- **High Contrast**: Ensures visibility and reduces eye strain during extended play
- **Emotionally Positive**: Colors that create a welcoming, non-intimidating learning environment
